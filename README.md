# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The main purpose for the new analysis was to determine the differences between each city type total amount of rides, drivers, fares, and average fare per ride, drivers. As well, create a multiple line plot that would demonstrate a weekly fare for each of the city types.

## Results

![Summary](https://github.com/Kevin-C3923/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/pyBer_summary.png)

When looking at at the summary of the data frame, there are some clear information that stands out. For starter, the amount for "Total Ride" between Rural and Suburban are greatly less compared to Urban, Rural (125), Suburban (625) and Urban (1,625). This is the same for "Total Drivers", Rural (78), Suburban (490) and Urban (2,405), and for "Total Fares", Rural ($4,327.93), Suburban ($19,356.33) and Urban ($39,854.38). However, when comes to the average, that when things flipped. With "Average Fares per Ride" the price for Rural is at ($34.62) and Suburban is at ($30.97), compare that to Urban price which is at ($24.53). Then for "Average Fare per Driver", Rural drivers can bring in a total of ($55.49) with Suburban drivers getting ($39.50) and Urban drivers only getting ($16.57). Even do it looks like Rural drivers are doing better then Urban drivers, in the multiple line plot, it shows that may not be the case.

With the graph only showing from January 2019 up to May 2019, it can be seen that the Total Fare by city are greatly different from one another. For Rural city their highest Total Fare was only $500, which happened April, this is 1.5 less then Suburban lowest Total Fare and 2.5 less then Urban lowest Total Fare.

## Summary

With the results given from both the summary and the graph, there some things that can be done in order to approve the quality for each driver depending on there city type. One recommendation could be asking drivers from Urban city if they are welling to work in Suburban and Rural areas. This would decrease the amount of driver in the city type allowing indiviual drivers to pick up more customer and increase the average for Drivers in Urban areas.
Additionally, if we are able to get more drivers in Rural and Suburban areas, we can decrease average fare per ride. Even do it may sound counterproductive, if the price of a ride is more reasonable/ lower there would be more people that would be intrested in calling for rides which would be more beneficial as ther drivers feel that it is worth doing this job.
The last recommendation would be more advertisement with a type of benefit if they use our driving company. These benefit can vary from small rewards, discount rides or even a chance to win a major sweep states, but they have keep using are driving company to get it. This idea would temp people to keep using our driving company, but have to make sure that reward is worth it.
